Rails Widgets
=======

Rails Widgets is a collection of UI Widgets for RubyOnRails (in form of ActionView helpers).
You can add tabbed navigations, progressbars, rounded boxes etc in a snap.
All the widgets generate and inline their own CSS. Once your page is up and running you can extract and customize them as you wish.

Originally it works as a plugin. Now it could be installed as a plugin OR added to your project as a gem. Enjoy!

If you use this as a gem - don't forget to require widgets in application
	$ require 'widgets'
